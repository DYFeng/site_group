INSTALLATION:

Upload the Abstrakt Theme folder to your Wordpress Theme directory (wp-content/themes/). Now go to the Wordpress admin panel, and then to Presentation. From here, select the Abstrakt Theme theme.

CHANGING THE HEADER:

To replace the header text with your blog name, install the Futura font found in the files folder. Then open the head.psd with Photoshop and change the text.

Save the image as head.png and upload it to the images directory of the theme (wp-content/themes/Abstrakt Theme/images/) and overwrite the other file.

-----------

You can use this theme freely, as long as you leave our links in the footer.
Thanks, as always.

 WP Simplicity is very easy to install and use. All you need to do is select a few options 
and hit the “Update WP Simplicity Settings” button. It cannot get any easier than that. 
You can use the built in installer, or you can install the plugin manually.

1. Download, unzip and use your FTP program to upload it to your wp-content/plugins directory the top-level folder. Don't just upload all the php files and put them in /wp-content/plugins/. You can either use the automatic plugin installer after download to your PC.

That's it!
